Visual search is a technology or technique that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to search for and retrieve images or objects that share visual similarities with a given query image. It involves the analysis of visual features, patterns, and attributes within images to find and present visually similar content.

We delve into 3 key concepts in the realm of visual search, each with its unique significance and real-life applications. The first concept, "Image Search by Artistic Style," explores the notion of searching for images based on specific artistic styles, enhancing user experiences in platforms like eCommerce websites and art galleries. Combining style similarity with other factors, such as image subject or category, provides users with more relevant search results.

The second concept, "Visual Search (Similarity)," is a technology that harnesses the power of computer vision and machine learning to find visually similar images or objects. This technology has implications in fashion and automotive industries. It empowers users to discover products and content based on visual characteristics, revolutionizing the way we search for information.

The third concept, "Visual Search (Variational Autoencoder)," are pivotal in unsupervised learning, offering the ability to learn embeddings of images for tasks such as nearest neighbor search. The report highlights the importance of this concept in daily life, from enhanced image search to personalization, and showcases the application of VAEs in platforms like Pinterest.

Each of these concepts represents a significant advancement in the field of visual search and plays a vital role in enhancing user experiences, expanding the possibilities of image retrieval, and enabling personalization in various domains. The report explores the technology and models used in these concepts, providing a comprehensive understanding of their applications and implications in real-life scenarios.
